Annotation commonly used in Model layer that from Hibernate or SQL:

@Entity annotation shows that the class is a persistent Java class.
@Id annotation shows that the annotated field is the primary key.
@GeneratedValue annotation is used to specify the generation strategy used for the primary key.
@Column annotation defines the column in the database that maps the annotated field.
@CreationTimestamp annotation is a JPA annotation that automatically updates the todo creation timestamp.
@UpdateTimestamp annotation is a JPA annotation that automatically updates the todo last modified timestamp.

Annotation commonly used in Model layer that from Lombok:
@Data annotation is from project Lombok. It generates the getters and setters for all the fields that we have in the todo class, equals method, and a toString method.
@NoArgsConstructor annotation is from project Lombok and it generates an empty constructor for our Todo class.
@AllArgsConstructor annotation is from project Lombok and it generates a constructor with all the fields that are available in our Todo class.
@Builder annotation is from project Lombok. It makes it possible for us to use the builder pattern with our Todo model.
