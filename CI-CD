 .gitignore files (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore)
 Git sees every file in your working copy as one of three things:
 
 tracked - a file which has been previously staged or committed;
 untracked - a file which has not been staged or committed; 
 ignored - a file which Git has been explicitly told to ignore.
 
 Ignored files are usually build artifacts and machine generated files that can be derived from your repository source or should otherwise not be committed. 
 Some common examples are:
 
 dependency caches, such as the contents of /node_modules or /packages
 compiled code, such as .o, .pyc, and .class files
 build output directories, such as /bin, /out, or /target
 files generated at runtime, such as .log, .lock, or .tmp
 hidden system files, such as .DS_Store or Thumbs.db
 personal IDE config files, such as .idea/workspace.xml



Most of time don't commit to master branches always mereg new branch. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH7RT1KHbv8)
