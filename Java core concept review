1. How to choose between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, set? 
  vector character is synchonized. 
  ArrayList(Array) good at storing, accessing data. 
  LinkedList easy to manipulating data (changes).
  Set doesn't allow duplicate by default. 
  Array is considered as “indexed collection” type of data structure, while Set is considered as “keyed collection”.

2. Difference between abstract and inferface class in Java expecially after Java 8
  After introducing Default Method, it seems that interfaces and abstract classes are same. However, they are still different concept in Java 8.
  Abstract class can define constructor. They are more structured and can have a state associated with them. 
  While in contrast, default method can be implemented only in the terms of invoking other interface methods, 
  with no reference to a particular implementation's state. 
  Hence, both use for different purposes and choosing between two really depends on the scenario context.
