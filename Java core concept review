1. How to choose between Vector, ArrayList, LinkedList, set? 
  vector character is synchonized. 
  ArrayList(Array) good at storing, accessing data. 
  LinkedList easy to manipulating data (changes).
  Set doesn't allow duplicate by default. 
  Array is considered as “indexed collection” type of data structure, while Set is considered as “keyed collection”.
